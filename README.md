# FAQ JSON-LD Manager

A WordPress plugin to manage FAQ items as a custom post type (CPT) and inject FAQ JSON-LD into posts/pages. Designed for performance and scalability with advanced cache management, background queueing, and admin/CLI tools.

## Features

- **Custom Post Type:** Manage FAQ items via the `faq_item` CPT.
- **Mapping Table:** Fast MySQL table (`fqj_mappings`) links FAQ items to posts, post types, terms, URLs, or global context.
- **JSON-LD Output:** Injects FAQ schema on the frontend, with per-post transient caching.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Background queue (WP-Cron or WP-CLI) for efficient cache purging.
- **Admin UI:** Meta boxes and settings for mapping, output, and diagnostics.
- **Health & Diagnostics:** Admin page for queue/logs and manual actions.
- **WP-CLI Integration:** Commands for cache and queue management.

## Installation

1. Copy the plugin folder to your WordPress `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate via the WordPress admin Plugins page.
3. On activation, the mapping table is created automatically.

## Usage

- **Add FAQ Items:** Use the `FAQ Items` CPT in the admin menu.
- **Associate FAQs:** Use meta boxes to link FAQs to posts, post types, terms, URLs, or globally.
- **Settings:** Configure cache TTL, batch size, and output type under the FAQ Items > Settings menu.
- **Health:** Monitor queue/logs and run manual actions under FAQ Items > Health.
- **WP-CLI:**
  - `wp fqj purge-transients` — Purge all FAQ JSON-LD transients.
  - `wp fqj process-queue [--limit=N]` — Process the invalidation queue.
